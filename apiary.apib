# Digital Dispatch API for Partners
<a name="Introduction"></a>
Digital Dispatch API for Partners allow third party partners applications to share real-time Dispatch Status information with the customer whenever they want it, however they want it. In general, the 4 Dispatch Statuses we will attempt to collect are: in-route, on-scene, tow-in-progress (when applicable), and job-complete. Dispatch Status updates always include timestamps, and sometimes (depending on the technology involved) include geostamps as well.

Agero will convey Dispatch Status information to its customers via 5 different methods: 1) Website, 2) Text Message & Email, 3) IVR, 4) Client-branded Mobile Apps, and 5) Connected Vehicle. In addition to that , Roadside Connect applications will allow third party developers to:

• Create a demo account for sales and marketing purposes

• Capture pictures of the customer’s vehicle for accident events and damage claims

• Incorporate optical character recognition functionality for VIN and odometer

• Implement Beacon Software Tow Spec API

• Implement Driver & truck picture approval capability

• Incorporate the ability for a service provider to scan and send crisp, clear images of receipts & towing documents and upload to a server

• Assign default tow truck image to client’s logo (Cadillac specifically) for Mobile Tech dispatches • Enable a data pop in One Road for dispatches cancelled via Roadside Connect

• Manage the ‘Driver’ role including adding additional profile field data such as name and cell phone

• Mobile Instant Dispatch – allow user(s) with appropriate ‘dispatcher’ credentials to accept/reject dispatch requests for other users/drivers and assign jobs to drivers o This includes profile management (add, edit, view a list of drivers)

## Group 4 Security API

The "Security" API is designed to allow client applications to securely use Roadside Connect backend services once the users are 
authenticated and authorized by this API. In order to use this API, the users will have to log into Agero Support at agerosupport.com 
and create a user name and password. Once the users have generated their login credentials, they will be able to log into the client 
application and extend the login session if the application is left idle for a configurable number of minutes. The users will also have the
option to log out of the app if the users do not want to extend the login session or they just simply want to logout at any moment in the time 
from the app.Currently, there are two types of users that can use the Roadside Connect Services:

* Manager/Owner
* Dispatcher
* Driver

A Dispatcher and Manager has the same rights and permissions as the Owner has. They can create and update profiles, accept or reject new jobs, assign jobs to drivers, updated job status and manage fleet map.
A driver can create and update their own profile, update job status for assigned jobs.

## 4.1 Login [/auth/login]

### Description
Login API

In order to login into a Client App, users will have to create a new account in Agerosupport.com.
Users will be able to log into an application by entering the user id and password. The Security API will validate these credentials along with the API key provided by the client application. Once the validation is successful, the Security API will create and return a valid SWT token along with a flag that indicates if the logged in user has to accept a new version of terms & conditions. (If the Terms and Condition flag is true, the client application can follow the terms & conditions accept / decline workflow that is documented in the Terms and Conditions API section of this document).
If the users provide an incorrect username and/or password, security API will return an error code that could be mapped to a user friendly authentication failure message on the client application.

## 4.2 Refresh Token [/auth/refreshToken]

###Description
Refresh Token API

The "Refresh Token " API allows client applications to protect user accounts if the application has been left idle for a certain number of minutes. The inactivity period can be configured in the backend. When the configured expiration time period has passed (without having the user responding to the job requests, assigning jobs, setting job status, or updating profile, driver, facilities, equipment, or other activities), the user will be able to refresh the token or opt to logout of the app.
If the user decides to extend the login session before token expiration, the Refresh Token API will refresh the access token based on the supplied refresh_token.

See: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-47 for more information.

# Group 5 Dispatch API
## 5.1 Get Dispatch List [/dispatches?forDriver={driverIds}&dispatchStatusList={dipatchStatusCodes}&startDateTime={startDate}&endDateTime={endDate}&poNumbers={POs}&serviceTypes={ServiceTypes}]

### Description
Once dispatches are generated in One Road and assigned to Vendors through the Automated Dispatch process, the "Get Dispatch list" API will allow user to get a list of dispatches based on role:
   
- For Owner/Dispatcher/Manager, the API returns a list of dispatches for the vendor, including new offers and unassigned jobs.
- For Driver, the API returns a list of dispatches for the currently logged-in driver.

The Get Dispatch API will return information available in the following business objects: Dispatches, Vehicle, Disablement Location, and Assigned Driver.
Pagination is available and enforced for this request.

###API Business Rules

- The for Driver parameter is optional. If this parameter is omittes, the API will list dispatches based on login/role. If a driver is specified , the API will query for the specific driver, and only if the role = Owner or Dispatcher.
- The dispatchStatusList parameter is a comma separated list of dispatch statuses the user is interested in. This is optional and if not provided, all dispatches will be returned. For possible values of dispatch status codes: Please refer to "Valid Status Codes" resource from Dispatch Status API
- The startDate(mm/dd/yyyy) and endDate (mm/dd/yyyy) parameters ----These parameters allow the consumer of the API to retrieve a list of dispatches which fall within a specific date range. These parameters are optional and following rules apply:
  * Both startDate and endDate are provided----endDate has to be later than startDate. Exception(HttpStatusCode:400) will be thrown otherwise
  * Neither startDate nor endDate are provided---- current date will be applied for both startDate and endDate.
  * Only startDate is provided with no endDate-----current date will be applied to endDate.
  * Only endDate is provided with no startDate----this is not allowed. endDate always requires a startDate. Exception(HttpStatusCode:400) will be thrown otherwise

## 5.4 Submit Dispatch Acceptance [/dispatches/{dispatchRequestNumber}/acceptDispatchRequest]

###Description

The Submit Dispatch Acceptance API will allow users to submit acceptance for a new job offer. The user will have to enter the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 
and a reason in case if the user wants to provide details about special circumstances related to that job for dispatches greater than 90 minutes. 
The Dispatcher can enter one of the following reasons:.

- None
- Weather Emergency
- Extreme traffic in the area

Based on the CDE business rules, the maximum allowed ETA is 480 minutes. In addition, the user can opt to enter or not enter a special circumstances reason. 
Once the user provides the acceptance, CDE will evaluate the ETA and special circumstance reason and provide a push notification to the user, informing the user if the ETA
has been accepted or rejected by Agero. The push notification process is documented in the Push Notification API.

## 5.5 Submit Dispatch Refusal [/dispatches/{dispatchRequestNumber}/refuseDispatchRequest]

###Description

The "Submit Dispatch Refusal "API will allow users to refuse a new job offer. The user will have to enter a refusal reason from the list of refusal reasons available for
that job. Once the user provides and submits the refusal reason, CDE will receive the reason and offer that job to the next Service Provider (available for automated 
Dispatches if available – or a non-automated dispatch provider if none available). In this case, no push notification will be sent to the Service Provider that refused that job.

Dispatcher can select one of the following Rejection reasons codes:

|Reason Code |Reason Description 
|:---------- |:-------------------| 
|400         |Do not accept payment type| 
|406         |Proper equipment not available 501 |No longer offer service|

## Group 6 Dispatch Status API

All resources in the Dispatch Status API require a valid access token.  See the Security API in this document for more information on authenticating and using access tokens.

## 6.1 Valid Status Codes [/enumerations/dispatchStatus]

Dispatch Status Business Rules
Agero sends new job offers to Service Providers. There are 3 dispositions for a new job: "New", "Work in Progress", and "Closed".

###"New" Disposition captures the following statuses
* New – when the dispatcher receives a new job offer
* Expired –when the new job offer has not been accepted or rejected by the Service Provider
* Pending – when the dispatcher requested an additional one minute before accepting or refusing
* Refused –when the dispatcher refuses the new job offer
* Rejected – when Agero rejects the ETA submitted by the dispatcher
* Unassigned –when the ETA submitted by the Dispatcher has been accepted but the job has not been assigned to a driver

###"Work in Progress" Disposition captures the following statuses
* Assigned –when a Dispatcher assigns a job to a driver
* In Route – when the Driver is en route to the disablement location
* On Scene,
* Tow in Progress(for tow jobs)
* Destination Arrival
* Job Cleared.

###"Closed" Disposition captures the following statuses
* Cancel – SP Cancel
* Cancel – Customer Cancel
* Unsuccessful – No Vehicle
* Unsuccessful – No Customer
* Service Attempt Failed
    
The user is permitted to skip a status-node in the above flow.

If a status-node is skipped, the user is not permitted to later add the timestamp (because timestamps would then be out of order).

A job can be set to Cancellation or Unsuccessful Service at any time.

User will clarify why the job resulted in a Cancellation or an Unsuccessful Service.

Once a job reaches an end node (any status-node in the "Closed" disposition), then no further updates are permitted.

|Status Code |Description  | 
|:-----------|:----------- |

|4           |PO Needed| Readonly| 
|3           |Pending| Readonly|

|20          |In Route|

The OAuth authorization code ('auth code' for short) grant type is defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification. 
The benefit of auth code grant type is that current Agero’s customer base can authorize third-party client apps to
consume Agero’s APIs on their behalf. This enables end users not to divulge AgeroSupport passwords to any entity 
except Agero. Agero as an API provider provides a Login app that authenticates end users and that supports the
    redirects associated with the auth code grant type. "Three-legged OAuth" is so named because the pattern involves 
three distinct interactions among cooperating entities. The three transactions are: 

1. Authenticate the app end user, authorize client app, and recieve an authorization code 
2. Exchange authorization code for access token 
3. Use access token to securely invoke protected resource (API) 

There are 5 entities who participate in this oAuth 'dance'.

| Name|Description  |Activities|Implemented by|
|:--------------|:-------------|:----------|:---|:-------------|   
| App end user   (Service Provider)       |  The human user of the client app       | Provides username/password to  authenticate, authorizes client app to act on her behalf   | N/A|
|     Client app        |  The app that accesses protected resource on behalf of the app  end user   | Redirects app end user to authorization server, exchanges auth code for access token, makes   request to protected resource (API) using access token|   App developer i.e. third party  partners  /vendors |
|     Login/Consent app         |  A web-based authentication form,  which provides an interface where   app end users authenticate with an API provider  |Validates app end user username/password, optionally displays consent information  |Agero|
|     Authorization    endpoint           |    URI that a client app calls to   exchange auth code for an access token| Verifies that an authorization code is valid for a client app. Returns access  tokens to client apps that present valid auth codes|Agero| 
|     Token endpoint      |  URI that a client app calls to  exchange auth code for an access token  |Verifies that an authorization code is valid for a client app. Returns access  tokens to client apps that present valid auth codes|Agero| 
|     Protected resource      |   A service that can be accessed via an API and which is protected by a policy that validates access tokens |API provider-specific data or services |Agero| 
   
   
The basic three-legged flow is:

### First leg: Part One
   
![FirstLeg:PartOne](https://apiportal.agero.com/sites/default/files/OAuthFirstlegpartone.jpg)

1.App end user navigates to client’s app

2.User initiates OAuth authentication process

3.The  client app invokes a URL on the authorization server

4.The authorization endpoint redirects the request (along with relevant information) to Agero Login app


### First leg: Part Two

![FirstLeg:PartTwo](https://apiportal.agero.com/sites/default/files/OAuthFirstlegparttwo.jpg)

1.Agero  Login app collects the Service Provider’s username and password. (The Login app provides a way for the app end user to authorize the app to access the API on her behalf.)

2.Once authenticated, the Service Provider is redirected, along with an auth code, back to client app.

3.The client app handles a call back from the authorization endpoint to obtain the access token from the response. (The authorization endpoint uses the "Callback URL" configured in the profile for the client app to make this callback.)


### Second leg:

![SecondLeg](https://apiportal.agero.com/sites/default/files/OAuthSecondleg.jpg)

1.The app generates a request for an access token. The request includes the auth code from the first leg, along with the app's consumer key and secret.

2.The app sends this request to a token endpoint, whose URL has been provided out-of-band.

3.The token endpoint validates the auth code and the app credentials, and, if they are valid, generates an access token.

4.The token endpoint returns the access token to the client app.


### Third leg:

![ThirdLeg](https://apiportal.agero.com/sites/default/files/OAuthThirdleg.jpg)

1.The app generates a request that includes the access token to the protected API

2.The protected API validates the access token and evaluates any 'scope' parameters attached to the request

3.If the access token is valid for the request API resource and scope, then the resource is returned to the app.

The app developer must implement an auth code client capable of generating the three requests.

## 15.6 SignIn [/oauth/signIn] 
###Description

SiginIn API

After a Third Party partner obtains an access token on behalf of the vendor, Partner can use this API to signin the vendor. 
Calling this API will inform Agero that vendor is logged in to a system(third party system) capable of acceptiong edispatches 
and hence will offer a job electronically to the vendor. If the vendor does not respond to the edispatch promptly, vendor
shall receive an IVR Call / Manual call from a live agent

app. Calling this API has the reverse effect of signin api i.e. it will inform Agero that vendor is logged out 
of a system(third party system) and is not capable of acceptiong edispatches . If the client the vendor signed 
out of is indeed the last and only client vendor was logged in to, Agero will not attempt to offer a dispatch
electronically.

# Group 16 Server to server Notifications API
Set of APIs in this section have been designed to be used by third party developers who expect to receive notifications from Roadside Connect to the applications or services running on their servers.  These are different than device push notifications directly sent to mobile devices (see section 9 in this document).  
A third party who wishes to receive notifications using this method need to implement as REST service on their end as specified in 16.2 Receive Server Notification.

The server to server notification process can be described in brief in following steps

•   Register for notifications, provide a callback url and notification token

•   Implement a REST endpoint point on their own server 

•   Receive notification  

•   Acknowledge (Optional)
## 16.1 Subscribe To Server Notifications [/serverNotifications/subscribe]

# Group 24 HeatMap API
The set of APIs in this section have been designed to be used by third party developers which would enable them to provide HeatMap data to Agero on a real time basis. HeatMap services will be invoked by Agero in one of two use cases. 

First, there is the case where we are looking to quickly serve a disabled motorist. We will seek to collect the location and status of available Service Provider's drivers/vehicles within a X-mile radius of a location provided by Agero.

The request information packet will include the following:

(a) the dispatch request ID

(b) the disablement location street address

•   Street address (required)

•   Cross street (optional)

•   City (required)

•   State (required)

•   Zip (optional)

(c) the disablement location lat/long

(d) mileage radius of interest – expressed in miles (required)

(e) equipment type (optional)

(f) vendor_id list (optional)

The response information packet will include the following:

(a) a geostamps (lat/long) for each Service Provider vehicle within the radius

(b) for each such vehicle within the radius, the Status of Service Provider vehicle,the timestamp for the Status

(c) the unique identifier for each such Service Provider (using the Agero vendor ID vehicle )

(d) and for each such vehicle that is currently in either an “assigned” or “en route” status provide the disablement location of such assignment 

 •   Lat/long (required)

 •   Street address (optional)

 •   Cross street (optional)

 •   City (optional)

 •   State (optional)

 •   Zip (optional)

(e) and for each such vehicle on a “tow” assignment, that is currently an “assigned” , “en route”, “on scene”, or “tow in progress” status provide the tow-to-location of such assignment

 •   Lat/long (required)

 •   Facility Name (optional)

 •   Street address (optional)

 •   Cross street (optional)

 •   City (optional)

 •   State (optional)

 •   Zip (optional)

(f) driver name


Second, there is the case where Agero is doing an hourly location poll of its national network. 

The response information packet will include the following:

(a) a geostamps (lat/long) for each Service Provider vehicle

(b) for each such vehicle the Status of Service Provider vehicle,the timestamp for the Status

(c) the unique identifier for each such Service Provider (using the Agero vendor ID vehicle )

(f) driver name

A third party who wishes to act as a HeatMap data provider using this method need to implement as REST service on their end as specified. 

The HeatMap process from 3rd- party partner’s perspective  can be described in brief in following steps

•   Enroll as a HeatMap provider, providing a HeatMap url and authorization token

•   Implement a REST endpoint on their own server 

•   Receive a request on HeatMap URL for  

•   Call an endpoint provided by Agero to notify the HeatMap data

NOTE: HeatMap API is just meant for 3rd-party partners and hence the Authentication to API just involves client credentials(i.e. Client’s consumer key) provided in Authorization header
